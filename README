By using AND, OR, XOR, Left Shift and Right Shift operations, I made a simple Hash Generator, which can convert any file into a string in length 8.
I run this code on CIMS Linserv1 server. This code is written in C. Use gcc to compile.

Sample usage:
Put Makefile and my_hash.c in a same folder.
$ make
$ echo sample message > sample_file.txt
$ ./my_hash  sample_file.txt
46e5f87b  // hash of sample_file.txt
